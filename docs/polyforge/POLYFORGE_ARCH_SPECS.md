# PolyForge 3D: Architectural Evolution & AI-Reproducible Design
**Forked from: [Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan3D-2.1](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan3D-2.1)**

This document details the transformation of the monolithic/script-based Hunyuan3D model into PolyForge 3D, a local-first, high-performance 3D generation backend designed for native app integration (Tauri).

---

## 1. Core Architectural Shift: The "Sidecar" Pattern

Hunyuan3D-2.1 is primarily a research-oriented codebase centered around PolyForge Launcher or individual inference scripts. PolyForge 3D migrates this to a **Sidecar Architecture**.

### Key Improvements:
- **Decoupled Frontend**: The GUI is a modern HTML/JS/CSS frontend served by a FastAPI backend, enabling native desktop integration via Tauri.
- **Unified Entry Point**: `launcher.py` handles environment setup, dynamic port allocation, and sub-process lifecycle management.
- **Dynamic Port Allocation**: Uses `find_free_port` to avoid collisions with other local dev servers (e.g., PolyForge Launcher defaults).

## 2. Robust Backend Management (The Engine Room)

The original repo loads models directly in a script. PolyForge 3D introduces two critical abstractions in `hy3dgen/manager.py`:

### ModelManager (Resource Isolation)
- **LRU Cache & VRAM Safety**: Automatically offloads models from VRAM when switching between `Normal` (Text-to-3D) and `Multiview` pipelines.
- **Lazy Loading**: Models are registered as loaders and only fetched into memory when the first request hits the queue.
- **Aggressive Garbage Collection**: Explicitly triggers `gc.collect()` and `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` after every generation step.

### PriorityRequestManager (Asynchronous Queue)
- **Non-blocking Execution**: Uses `asyncio.PriorityQueue` to handle multiple incoming API requests.
- **Worker Loops**: A configurable number of workers (default: 1 for low-VRAM safety) process jobs sequentially from the queue.
- **Job Cancellation**: Uses `threading.Event` to propagate cancellation signals from the API down to the inference pipeline.

---

## 3. Polymorphic API Design

The API in `hy3dgen/api/` is built on **Pydantic V2**, ensuring type safety and documentation generation.

### Schema Patterns (`schemas.py`):
- **Universal Job Model**: `JobRequest` wraps inputs, constraints (resolution, format), quality presets, and post-processing steps.
- **MeshOps Integration**: A dedicated `MeshOpsRequest` allows for "post-generation" transformations (repair, decimation, auto-texturing).
- **Polymorphic Endpoints**: `/v1/jobs` can handle multiple generation modes via a discriminant `mode` field.

### Routing Logic (`routes.py`):
- **Background Task Wrapper**: Uses FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` to immediately return a `job_id` and process the generation in the background.
- **In-Memory History**: Tracks job status (`QUEUED`, `GENERATING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`) for polling.

## 4. Advanced Post-Processing: MeshOps Engine

Located in `hy3dgen/meshops/`, this is a significant extension over the base model.

### Design Features:
- **DAG-based Execution**: Operations are topologically sorted based on a `depends_on` field, allowing complex pipelines (e.g., Cleanup -> Decimate -> Repair -> Texture).
- **Blender Integration**: Uses a headless Blender pipeline for high-fidelity tasks like `.blend` conversion and native UV/Baking.
- **Native Baking**: High-to-low poly baking for Normal and AO maps.

## 5. IPC Bridge: `sidecarClient.js`

This file is the specific engineering solution for communicating between a (potentially) sandboxed frontend and the Python sidecar.

### Essential Logic for Recreation:
1. **Dynamic Backend Detection**: Detects `window.location.origin` to route API calls correctly whether in Tauri or standard web browser.
2. **Request Normalization**: Wraps simple parameters into the complex `JobRequest` schema expected by the FastAPI backend.
3. **Smart Polling**: Implements an exponential/fixed-backoff polling mechanism to track background job completion.
4. **Parameter Unwrapping**: Handles IPC bridge nuances (like Tauri's `object` wrapping) to ensure data reaches Python in the correct Pydantic format.

## 6. Implementation Guide for AI Agents

To recreate these improvements from the base Hunyuan3D project, follow these steps:

1.  **Wrap the Inference Pipeline**: 
    - Don't call the pipeline directly. Create an `InferencePipeline` class that encapsulates the model loading and `__call__` logic.
2.  **Implement the Serial Manager**: 
    - Create a singleton `PriorityRequestManager`.
    - Use `asyncio.run_in_executor` to offload the heavy Torch computation so it doesn't block the API event loop.
3.  **Define JSON Schemas**:
    - Build Pydantic models for all inputs. Reject any request that doesn't strictly adhere to these schemas.
4.  **Create the MeshOps Pipeline**:
    - Use `trimesh` for geometric modifications.
    - Implement a topological sort loop to process multiple operations on a single mesh instance.
5.  **Build a State-less Frontend**:
    - Serve the HTML/JS from the FastAPI app itself using `app.mount("/", StaticFiles...)`.
    - Use `fetch` for all interactions to the `/v1` endpoints.
6.  **Add System Telemetry**:
    - Add a `/v1/system/monitor` endpoint that returns GPU stats via `torch.cuda`.
